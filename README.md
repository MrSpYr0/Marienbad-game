# Marienbad-game
This game was becoming famous with the French film «L'année dernière à Marienbad » of Alain Resnais in 1961. This game is a zero-sum game. For playing, we dispose some sticks in line : 1 stick on the first line, 3 sticks on the second line, 5 sticks on the third line, 7 sticks on the fourth line, Each turn, the player can take a certain number of sticks on the same line, but at least 1 stick. The player who take the last stick lose,. But in the film, a protagonist say : "Je peux perdre, mais je gagne toujours… " which mean, I can lose but I always win ...

In this code, I represent the board by matrix and each line by a list. The 1 represents a stick and the 0 represents a void. It's a simple algorithm in python with different level of difficulties. The texts and comments are in French
